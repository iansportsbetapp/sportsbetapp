# sportsbetapp
an app for sports betting

App for facilitating informed bets on sporting events Project title: Placeholder app title is sportsbetapp

Project Description:

sportsbetapp is an online application that provides users with customized data feeds for the purpose of helping users make educated bets when gambling on sporting events.

Users are able to create profiles that populate data to a dashboard based on the following filters: -athlete -sport -event -venue

Each of the above categories will have dedicated metrics (like athlete_weight, venue_city…) by which customers can also apply filters. Each customer’s dashboard will display information limited to their chosen filters. Data will be obtained from one or more API’s relating to sports and/or sports gambling.

Accounts will be free and for initial versions, any monetization would be through advertising on the website, rather than by subscription.

First version must: -Allow customers to log in with usernames and passwords. -Customers can filter by: -athlete -sport -event -venue -athletemetric -sportmetric -eventmetric -venuemetric -Link to one API that provides free or very cheap information on all of the above categories. -Display a dashboard that populates data based on customers’ filter preferences.

The focus for early versions will be: -developing a more robust user experience. -applying more advanced algorithms for processing and presenting data. -integration with more numerous and relevant APIs

Future versions may include: -Algorithms that provide more complex and unique data analysis for customers. -Algorithms that provide odds or risk/reward values. -Mobile web friendly. -Mobile app -Montized via subscriptions -Email/text updates -Payment processing via a provider (like Stripe). -Offer online bookie services?
